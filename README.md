# aether

Aether aims to be a very simple 2D framework intended to be used in several platforms with decoupled functionality in backends for rendering, application and input handling.

**This library is heavily in development**

## Platform backends

* Linux and Windows using [allegro](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5) or [sdl](https://github.com/SDL-mirror/SDL)

## To-Do very far in the future

* Support for 3DS Homebrew using [Citro2D](https://github.com/devkitPro/citro2d) (**in progress**)
* Support for Vita Homebrew
