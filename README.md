# aether

Aether is a 2D framework intended to be used in several platforms with decoupled functionality in backends for rendering, app handling and input. The currently targeted systems are Linux, Windows and PS Vita Homebrew with VitaSDK. Mac version is not planned since I don't have a Mac to test with.

**Please note that this library is heavily in development**

## TODO

* Enhance texture handling since the method in use does not reuse handles
* Support for PS Vita Homebrew backend.
* Implement Animation and Spritesheet classes
* Refactor math code, inherited from alligator
